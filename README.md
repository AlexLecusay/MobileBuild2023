# RoaryMinders
Welcome to RoaryMinders, the ultimate app for students to stay organized and connect with their classmates!

With RoaryMinders, students can easily add or remove classes from their schedules. Once they've added a class, they can create topics within the class to help them stay on track with their coursework. Students can add or remove topics as needed, making it easy to manage their workload.

RoaryMinders also features a messaging system within each topic, allowing students to communicate with their classmates about specific assignments or questions. With RoaryMinders, students can collaborate and support each other in their academic pursuits.

RoaryMinders was developed using [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/), ensuring a seamless native Android and iOS experience for all users. And with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the backend, students can trust that their data is secure and easily accessible.

Various tools were employed, such as project management software and code reviews, to ensure organization and quality.
